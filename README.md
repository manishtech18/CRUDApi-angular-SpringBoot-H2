# CRUDApi-angular-SpringBoot-H2



This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Spring Boot on the backend, Angular 17 on the frontend, and an H2 in-memory database for data persistence. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to set up a simple full-stack application with RESTful API endpoints for basic CRUD operations.
