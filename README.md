# CRUDApi-angular-SpringBoot-H2



This project is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Spring Boot on the backend, Angular 17 on the frontend, and an H2 in-memory database for data persistence. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to set up a simple full-stack application with RESTful API endpoints for basic CRUD operations.



Technology Stack

Backend:

Spring Boot (v3.x): Java-based framework for building web applications.
Spring Data JPA: For database operations.
H2 Database: In-memory relational database for testing and development.
Spring Web: For building RESTful APIs.
Spring Boot DevTools: Provides live reload and faster application restart during development.


Frontend:

Angular (v17.x): Modern, component-based framework for building web applications.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
Bootstrap: For responsive and mobile-first UI design.
Angular HTTPClient: For interacting with the backend REST APIs.




Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Java 17 or higher

Node.js (v18.x) and npm (v9.x)
